          <p> My favourite thing to do when I am free is dance . I am a dancer and I love to dance , I am a classical dancer as well as contemporary too, I can dance on any language song . Let me introduce myself I am Sampurna Gope , I am 12 year old and I am in 7th grade . My hobby is very tough to keep because every kid have it when they are small but it is hard to keep till you grow up , ofcourse if you try you can keep it to . Dance can keep one very happy everytime and busy.Dance burns calories, strengthens muscles, improves balance, increases flexibility, and gives the heart a good workout. Dance has also been proven to increase cognitive development.So, I guess you will like dancing to!!!.
